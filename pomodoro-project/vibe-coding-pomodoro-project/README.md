# Vibe Coding Pomodoro Timer Project (Replit Ghostwriter AI)

This project is a fully functional Pomodoro Timer application built using **React** and styled with **Tailwind CSS**. It was developed using the **Replit Ghostwriter AI Agent (Vibe Coding)** methodology, focusing on high-level command prompts rather than manual coding.

The project demonstrates the Agent's ability to handle complex state management and multi-file changes based on natural language instructions.

## 🚀 Features

* **Two Cyclical Modes:** The user can switch between two predefined cyclical modes:
    * **Intense Mode:** 45 minutes of Work followed by 15 minutes of Break.
    * **Standard Mode:** 25 minutes of Work followed by 5 minutes of Break.
* **Automatic Transition:** The timer automatically transitions from Work to Break mode when the session is complete.
* **Control Buttons:** Standard Start, Stop, and Reset functionalities.
* **Visual Feedback:** Displays the remaining time in minutes and seconds.
* **Audio Alert:** Plays a sound notification when the timer transitions between Work and Break sessions.
